# WebScreenShare
WebScreenShare is a Python project built using Flask that allows users to share their screen. The project captures screenshots of the entire screen and converts them to PNG format, which is then streamed as a multipart response to the user's browser. The user can stop the screen sharing by clicking the "stop" button on the web page.
